            <h1>Rock Scroll Dagger</h1>
            <p id="intro-text">"The sun has just retreated and the cold November air begins covering the 
                woods with frost as you make your way back home. You feel the darkness creep upon you fast 
                and the fireflies which once flew about close to you have disappeared. You feel a sudden chill
                which can't be explained by the cold and wonder if someone ... or rather something ... is close
                behind. And then you hear it.<br>
                <i>'Are you leaving so soon?'</i> It takes a moment for you to realize that you hear this inside
                your head. <br>
                'How about this' says the voice. 'If you beat me at the old tavern game of Rock Scroll Dagger,
                I will let you leave. However, if you do not...well, let's not spoil the surprise shall we'.<br>
                You weren't prepared for this. All your satchel holds is a peculiar looking stone, a scroll with 
                illegible writing on it which you randomly found earlier and ah... yes... a dagger! Albeit, a 
                dagger which requires sharpening."
