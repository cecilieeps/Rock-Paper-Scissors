            <h1>Rock Scroll Dagger</h1>
            <p>"The sun has just retreated and the cold November air begins covering the 
                woods with frost as you make your way back home. You feel a sudden chill 
                down your spine and can't help but wonder if there is something lurking 
                deep within the woods.
                And then you see it. Green glowing eyes and a glint of something you can't
                quite make out. You weren't prepared for this. All your satchel holds is 
                a peculiar looking stone, a scroll with illegible writing you stumbled 
                across earlier and ah... yes... a dagger!"
            </p>
            <p>Select your weapon of choice:</p>
